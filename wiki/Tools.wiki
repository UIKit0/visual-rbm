=== idxinfo ===

Used to print an IDX file's header info (as described on the [FileFormats] wiki page).

==== Usage ====

{{{
idxinfo [INPUTS]
}}}

 * INPUTS - A list of IDX files whose header info you want to see.

====
 
=== catidx ===

Used to concatanate together multiple datasets (with the same row dimensions and dataformat) into a single IDX dataset.  For instance, the MNIST training and test images could be concatanted into a single dataset with 70,000 length 784 rows; 60,000 rows from the training images and 10,000 rows from the test images.

==== Usage ====

{{{
catidx [INPUTS] [OUTPUT]
}}}

 * INPUTS - A list of IDX files to concatanate together.  All the given IDX files must have the same data format and row dimensions.
 * OUTPUT - Destination to save the concatanated inputs.

====
 
=== joinidx ===

Used to join together multiple IDX datasets (with the same number of rows and dataformat) into a single IDX dataset.  For instance, the MNIST training images and training labels could be joined into a single dataset with 60,000 length 794 rows; 784 brightness values and 10 label values.

==== Usage ====
{{{
joinidx [INPUTS] [OUTPUT]
}}}

 * INPUTS - A list of IDX files to join together.  All the given IDX files must have the same data format and the same number of rows.
 * OUTPUT - Destination to save the joined inputs.

====
 
=== splitidx ===

Used to take a subset of an IDX file and split it off into a separate, smaller IDX file.  For instance, splitidx could be used to divide an entire dataset into a training set and a testing set.

==== Usage ====
{{{ 
splitidx [INPUT] [OUTPUT] [FROM] [COUNT]
}}}

 * INPUT - The input IDX file we are generating a subset dataset from.
 * OUTPUT - The output IDX file to save.
 * FROM - The starting index in INPUT to start pulling rows from.
 * COUNT - Optional.  The number of rows to write to the OUTPUT file.  If no COUNT is given, then all the rows after the given FROM index will be written to OUTPUT.
